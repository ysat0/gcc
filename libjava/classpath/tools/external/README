ASM is a bytecode processing library used by GNU Classpath's rmic and
javah tools.  It is not maintained as part of GNU Classpath, but is
imported into the repository for simpler builds.

The ASM project pages are at http://asm.objectweb.org/

The currently imported version is ASM 2.2.3.  The sources were checked
out of CVS using the ASM_2_2_3 tag.  I've only imported a subset of
the whole checkout: namely, LICENSE.txt and the sources themselves.
