This is a start at a GTK look and feel for Java.
It is usable already, but it mainly just defaults back to Basic Look and
Feel for everything.

Sliders are currently broken.  I haven't figured out why yet.

A bunch of system colors defined in GtkLookandFeel though I have a feeling 
I'll be defining more ColorUIResources shortly.

Based on Gnome File Manager colors... or my Window Manager setup
