This directory contains example programs that show how the GNU Classpath
library can be used.

Each example has its own package under gnu.classpath.examples and has a
class Demo which contains a main() method to run that particular example.

The examples can be compiled and run with gcj as follows:

  gcj -o swingdemo --main=gnu.classpath.examples.swing.Demo \
      gnu/classpath/examples/swing/Demo.java
  ./swingdemo

Or with a traditional byte code interpreter like:

  gcj -C gnu/classpath/examples/awt/Demo.java
  gij gnu.classpath.examples.awt.Demo

The installation also comes with an examples.zip archive that contains
all needed resources and compiled byte code class files that can be
run as follows:

  kaffe -classpath examples.zip gnu.classpath.examples.awt.Demo
  kaffe -classpath examples.zip gnu.classpath.examples.swing.Demo

All example code is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

The example icons used in some of the examples come from gnome-icon-theme
version 1.2.3 and are also distributed under the GPL.
All these images are stored in the directory gnu/classpath/examples/icons/.

More free icons can be found in the gnome-icon-theme package:
