	PR libgfortran/61933
	* io/inquire.c (inquire_via_unit): Set existing to true for
	any negative unit that is currently connected and any positive
	units within range of KIND=4 value.  The unit value for any out
	of range case that may occur if the user is using a KIND=8 will
	have been set to -2 which is reserved and can never be opened,
	and therefore the unit does not exist.
