This is banshee, a toolkit for constructing constraint-based program analyses.
See the user manual in docs/banshee.ps for a complete description of banshee.

This is a beta release of banshee. Although banshee has been designed to solve
many kinds of constraints, it has only been extensively tested on 
Andersen's-style points-to analysis.
