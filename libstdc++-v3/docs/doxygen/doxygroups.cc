/** @addtogroup SGIextensions
 *
 *  Because libstdc++-v3 based its implementation of the STL subsections of
 *  the library on the SGI 3.3 implementation, we inherited their extensions
 *  as well.
 *
 *  They are additionally documented in the
 *  <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/documentation.html">
 *  online documentation</a>, a copy of which is also shipped with the
 *  library source code (in .../docs/html/documentation.html).  You can also
 *  read the documentation <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/">on SGI's
 *  site</a>, which is still running even though the code is not maintained.
 *
 *  <strong>NB</strong> that the following notes are pulled from various
 *  comments all over the place, so they may seem stilted.
