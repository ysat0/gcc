Description of the libstdc++ ABI.

I. What is an ABI? What's covered? What's not?

- What's the deal with C++? Why can't different compiler's object
  files link with each other? Bug? Feature?

- scope of document, of use to system integrators.

- compilation includes and linked library binary must match up..

- library ABI, compiler ABI different (but effects)

- GNU C++ does not have a compiler command line option to switch
  between various different C++ ABIs. For instance, there is no way to
  switch between the gcc-3.0.x ABI, gcc-3.1.x ABI, and the gcc-3.2.x
  ABI during compilation. Other C++ compilers do allow this, and some
  g++ command line options may change the ABI (-fno-exceptions, see
  the complete list), but there is no version switch. Sorry. The GNU
  Project recommends that

- shared library only, static is immutable.

- Minimum environment that supports a versioned ABI: what's needed?  A
  supported dynamic linker, a GNU linker of sufficient vintage to
  understand demangled C++ name globbing (ld), a shared executable
  compiled with g++, and shared libraries (libgcc_s, libstdc++-v3)
  compiled by a compiler (g++) with a compatible ABI. Phew.

  On top of all that, an additional constraint: libstdc++ did not
  attempt to version symbols (or age gracefully, really) until version
  3.1.0. 

  Most modern Linux and BSD versions, particularly ones using
  gcc-3.1.x tools, will meet the requirements above.

- What configure options impact symbol versioning?
  There is only one: --enable-symvers. For more information see:
  http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/configopts.html

  In particular, libstdc++-v3/acinclude.m4 has a macro called
  GLIBCPP_ENABLE_SYMVERS that defaults to yes (or the argument passed
  in via --enable-symvers=foo). At that point, the macro attempts to
  make sure that all the requirement for symbol versioning are in
  place. For more information, please consult acinclude.m4. 

- How can I tell if symbol versioning is, indeed, active? 

  When the GNU C++ library is being built with symbol versioning on,
  you should see the following at configure time for libstdc++-v3:

checking versioning on shared library symbols... gnu

  If you don't see this line in the configure output, or if this line
  appears but the last word is 'no', then you are out of luck.

  If the compiler is pre-installed, a quick way to test is to compile
  the following (or any) simple C++ file:

#include <iostream>

int main()
{ std::cout << "hello" << std::endl; return 0; }

%g++ hello.cc -o hello.out
%nm hello.out

If you see symbols in the resulting output with "GLIBCPP_3.x" as part
of the name, then the executable is versioned. Here's an example:

         U _ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev@@GLIBCPP_3.1






II. ABI changes

- (anything) changing size of an exported symbol

- (anything) changing alignment of an exported symbol

- (anything) changing the layout of an exported symbol

- (anything) changing mangling on an exported symbol

- (anything) adding or deleting an exported symbol


III. Versioning

- include files

  - versioning headers with version, why necessary
    (need to control member/non-member functions, add delete files)

- shared library binaries

  - release versions

  - libtool versions

  - when does so version get a bump? what are the options?

  - how is the link map used?  

  - in an non-abi breaking minor release, how are symbols added?
    removed?

  - in an abi-breaking major release, what happens? symbol fall back


IV. Testing ABI changes

Currently, there is no formal testing for changes in the libstdc++
ABI. It would be in the best interest of GNU C++ users everywhere to
have such a test, and work to develop this test is ongoing.

There is a formal method for checking the compiler parts of the C++
ABI, donated by Intel. More information can be obtained
<a href="http://developer.intel.com/software/products/opensource/">here.</a>

To test the library, the following two ideas have been suggested:

One. 
(Brendan Kehoe, Jeff Law suggestion to run 'make check-c++' two ways, 
one with a new compiler and an old library, and the other with an old
compiler and a new library, and look for testsuite regressions)

Two.  
Have the libstdc++ testesuite proactively check the library
ABI. Probably a couple of items would be covered, although perhaps not
all would need to be done at once for this to be useful. Compute the
list of names exported in the shared version of libstdc++
binary. Then, save this list of names. Have this list of names
re-computed for each new binary of the same version. Next, use sizeof
and offset to compute offsets for each structure and type in the
standard library, saving to another datafile. Then, compute this for
new binaries, and look for differences.

The thought is to choose one or both of these approaches, and to use a
Makefile hook, perhaps 'make check-abi', to add this capability to the
libstdc++ testsuite.

Perhaps there are other Library ABI checkers. If so, please notify us.


V. Issues not directly addressed, and possible suggestions

- what to do about multi-ABI systems (nathan scenario)?

  - compatibility libs

  --enable-version-specific-runtime-libs

  - Alexandre Oliva proposal to have extended name attributes, modify ld
 
  - directory-level versioning

- wrapping C++ API's n "C" to use the C ABI.
