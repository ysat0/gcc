The library is maintained by Benjamin Kosnik, Gabriel

Development tools:
------------------

You will need a recent version of gcc to compile the snapshot of
libstdc++. The use of CVS gcc, or gcc-3_0-branch is strongly
recommended, which may introduce additional dependencies for
up-to-date binutils. In addition, you may need up-to-date tools for
modifying Makefiles and regenerating configure scripts: automake
(version 1.4), autoconf (version 2.13 and higher), and libtool.
