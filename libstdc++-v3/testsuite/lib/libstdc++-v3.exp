# This is the "tool init file" for libstdc++-v3.  There's nothing here.
# It's simply a placeholder for two reasons.  First, to show where we would
# put things, in case we ever want to take advantage of the tool init file.
# Second, to make dejagnu shut up about "WARNING could not find tool init
# file," which is harmless but tends to scare/confuse people.
