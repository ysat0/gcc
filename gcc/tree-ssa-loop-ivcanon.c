/* This pass detects the loops that iterate a constant number of times,
   adds a canonical induction variable (step -1, tested against 0) 
   and replaces the exit test.  This enables the less powerful rtl
   level analysis to use this information.

   This might spoil the code in some cases (by increasing register pressure).
   Note that in the case the new variable is not needed, ivopts will get rid
   of it, so it might only be a problem when there are no other linear induction
   variables.  In that case the created optimization possibilities are likely
   to pay up.

   Additionally in case we detect that it is beneficial to unroll the
   loop completely, we do it right here to expose the optimization
   possibilities to the following passes.  */
