/* Main data type to hold profile counters in GCC.  In most cases profile
   counts originate from profile feedback. They are 64bit integers
   representing number of executions during the train run.
   As the profile is maintained during the compilation, many adjustments are
   made.  Not all transformations can be made precisely, most importantly
   when code is being duplicated.  It also may happen that part of CFG has
   profile counts known while other do not - for example when LTO optimizing
   partly profiled program or when profile was lost due to COMDAT merging.

   For this information profile_count tracks more information than
   just unsigned integer and it is also ready for profile mismatches.
   The API of this data type represent operations that are natural
   on profile counts - sum, difference and operation with scales and
   probabilities.  All operations are safe by never getting negative counts
   and they do end up in uninitialized scale if any of the parameters is
   uninitialized.

   All comparsions that are three state and handling of probabilities.  Thus
   a < b is not equal to !(a >= b).

   The following pre-defined counts are available:

   profile_count::zero ()  for code that is known to execute zero times at
      runtime (this can be detected statically i.e. for paths leading to
      abort ();
   profile_count::one () for code that is known to execute once (such as
      main () function
   profile_count::uninitialized ()  for unknown execution count.
