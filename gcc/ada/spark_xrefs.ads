package SPARK_Xrefs is

   --  SPARK cross-reference information is stored internally using three
   --  tables: SPARK_Xref_Table, SPARK_Scope_Table and SPARK_File_Table, which
   --  are defined in this unit.

   --  Lib.Xref.SPARK_Specific is part of the compiler. It extracts SPARK
   --  cross-reference information from the complete set of cross-references
   --  generated during compilation.

   --  -------------------------------
   --  -- Generated Globals Section --
   --  -------------------------------

   --  The Generated Globals section is located at the end of the ALI file

   --  All lines with information related to the Generated Globals begin with
   --  string "GG". This string should therefore not be used in the beginning
   --  of any line not related to Generated Globals.

   --  The processing (reading and writing) of this section happens in package
   --  Flow_Generated_Globals (from the SPARK 2014 sources), for further
   --  information please refer there.

   ----------------
   -- Xref Table --
   ----------------

   --  The following table records SPARK cross-references

   type Xref_Index is new Nat;
   --  Used to index values in this table. Values start at 1 and are assigned
   --  sequentially as entries are constructed; value 0 is used temporarily
   --  until a proper value is determined.

   type SPARK_Xref_Record is record
      Entity : Entity_Id;
      --  Pointer to entity name in ALI file

      File_Num : Nat;
      --  File dependency number for the cross-reference. Note that if no file
      --  entry is present explicitly, this is just a copy of the reference for
      --  the current cross-reference section.

      Scope_Num : Nat;
      --  Scope number for the cross-reference. Note that if no scope entry is
      --  present explicitly, this is just a copy of the reference for the
      --  current cross-reference section.

      Rtype : Character;
      --  Indicates type of the reference, using code used in ALI file:
      --    r = reference
      --    c = reference to constant object
      --    m = modification
