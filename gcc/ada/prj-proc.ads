   --  Report_Error is null, use the error reporting mechanism. Otherwise,
   --  report errors using Report_Error.
   --
   --  If Follow_Links is False, it is assumed that the project doesn't contain
   --  any file duplicated through symbolic links (although the latter are
   --  still valid if they point to a file which is outside of the project),
   --  and that no directory has a name which is a valid source name.
   --
   --  When_No_Sources indicates what should be done when no sources
   --  are found in a project for a specified or implied language.
   --
   --  When Reset_Tree is True, all the project data are removed from the
   --  project table before processing.
   --
   --  Process is a bit of a junk name, how about Process_Project_Tree???
