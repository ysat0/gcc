; This file is processed by the script opts.sh.  It is a database of
; command line options, with each record separated by a blank line,
; and each field appearing on its own line.  The first field is the
; command-line switch with the leading "-" removed.  All options
; beginning with "f" or "W" are implicitly assumed to take a "no-"
; form; this form should not be listed.  If you do not want this
; negative form and you want it to be automatically rejected, add
; RejectNegative to the second field.

; The second field should contain "Java".  If the switch takes an
; argument, then you should also specify "Joined" and/or "Separate" to
; indicate where the argument can appear.

; Comments can appear on their own line anwhere in the file, preceded
; by a semicolon.  Whitespace is permitted before the semicolon.

; For each switch XXX below, an enumeration constant is created by the
; script opts.sh spelt OPT_XXX, but with all non-alphanumeric
; characters replaced with an underscore.

; Please try to keep this file in ASCII collating order.
