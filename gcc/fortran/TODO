Parser fixes:
------------

In a constant format string given to a data transfer statement, the
locus of any problems in the string isn't guaranteed to come out
right, because there is not a 1:1 correspondence between source
characters and characters in the string.  This scheme totally doesn't
work for format strings that are longer than a physical line.

Fix IMPLICIT to allow forward references of derived types.

Array issues in expressions and intrinsics.

Resolve scoping issues.  Create symbols in correct namespaces.

Finish resolution phase.

Finish compiler side of intrinsic functions.

Allow init exprs to be numbers raised to integer powers (negative too).

See about making emacs-parsable error messages.


Biggies:
--------

Interface to code generator.

Complete runtime library.


Known bugs:
-----------

Failure to set the expr_locus field in g95_expr structures.


And for the really pedantic
---------------------------

Fix INCLUDE such that it only appears on a single line.  The current
code allows things like:

      0I
      1NCLUDE "filename"

or its free form equivalent:

I&
NCLUDE "filename"

This is explicitly forbidden by the F95 standard (ref. section 3.4).
