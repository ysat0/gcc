Some tests in this directory are run in a msp430-specific "torture" style,
where all target specific options (that change code generation) are each used
on each test source file in turn.

The criteria for this torture style of testing is:
  - The source file has a .c suffix
  - The source file is in this "devices" subdirectory of the msp430 tests
  - Somewhere in the test file name matches the regex:
    [a-z0-9]+430[a-z0-9_]+(?=\.c).

Some of the options used to run the tests will produce warnings/errors for the
mcus, so ensure the test has dg-warning and dg-error directives as appropriate.
