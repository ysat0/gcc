# Enable multilibs:

MULTILIB_OPTIONS    = mmcu=msp430x mlarge
MULTILIB_DIRNAMES   = 430x large

# Match msp430X with msp430x.
MULTILIB_MATCHES    = mmcu?msp430x=mmcu?msp430X

# each supported MCU needs a line like this:
# MULTILIB_MATCHES  += mmcu?msp430x123=mmcu?msp430x

# The only way I figured this out was to hack the script to SHOW me
# what it's doing.  It's non-obvious, but it matches the directory
# structure of the multilib tree, but using the options, not the
# directory names.  A shell CASE statement is generated from these, so
# the usual CASE wildcards are supported.
