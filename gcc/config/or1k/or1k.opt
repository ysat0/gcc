mhard-div
Target RejectNegative InverseMask(SOFT_DIV)
Enable generation of hardware divide (l.div, l.divu) instructions.  This is the
default; use -msoft-div to override.

msoft-div
Target RejectNegative Mask(SOFT_DIV)
Enable generation of binaries which use functions from libgcc to perform divide
operations.  The default is -mhard-div.

mhard-mul
Target RejectNegative InverseMask(SOFT_MUL).
Enable generation of hardware multiply instructions (l.mul, l.muli) instructions.
This is the default; use -msoft-mul to override.

msoft-mul
Target RejectNegative Mask(SOFT_MUL).
Enable generation of binaries which use functions from libgcc to perform
multiply operations. The default is -mhard-mul.

mcmov
Target RejectNegative Mask(CMOV)
Enable generation of conditional move (l.cmov) instructions.  By default the
equivalent will be generated using using set and branch.

mror
Target RejectNegative Mask(ROR)
Enable generation of rotate right (l.ror) instructions.  By default functions
from libgcc are used to perform rotate right operations.

mrori
Target RejectNegative Mask(RORI)
Enable generation of rotate right with immediate (l.rori) instructions.  By
default functions from libgcc are used to perform rotate right with immediate
operations.

msext
Target RejectNegative Mask(SEXT)
Enable generation of sign extension (l.ext*) instructions.  By default memory
loads are used to perform sign extension.

msfimm
Target RejectNegative Mask(SFIMM)
Enable generation of compare and set flag with immediate (l.sf*i) instructions.
By default extra instructions will be generated to store the immediate to a
register first.

mshftimm
Target RejectNegative Mask(SHFTIMM)
Enable generation of shift with immediate (l.srai, l.srli, l.slli) instructions.
By default extra instructions will be generated to store the immediate to a
register first.
