This is a sample language front end for GCC.

This is a replacement for 'toy' which had potential copyright issues,
but more importantly it did not exercise very much of GCC. The intent
of this language is that it should provide a cookbook of language
elements that you can use in any language front end.

To this end, treelang is essentially an implementation of a subset of 
the GCC back end 'tree' interface in syntax.

Thanks to Richard Kenner, Joachim Nadler and many others for helping
me to understand enough of GCC to do this.
